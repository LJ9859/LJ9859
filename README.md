## Hello! Welcome to my profile! My GitHub username is LJ9859, but you can call me LJ for short. 👋
### Here are some things about myself:
- 👾 Always finding malware samples (Rogues especially! 😅)
- 🇺🇸 From the United States of America
- 📘 My main repository is LJ9859/Malware-Database ( https://www.github.com/lj9859/malware-database )
- 🚫🍴 Not accepting fork requests or pull requests at the moment
- 👀 If you want to contribute/add your own sample to the Malware-Database, open up an issue in the issues tab, link where the file is (must be from github), and password if there is one, and I will see if I can add it or not. If you made it, please specify so I can put it in the "Viewer-Made-Malware" folder.
- 😎 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- 💪 I try to be on GitHub atleast once a day. Got to keep that streak, you know?
- 🦠 The Desktop Buddies and Antivirus Rogues are the most interesting samples for me!
- ⚔️ My profile picture is A BURNING SUPER DEATH SWORD
- 💻 I know the basics of the Batch programming language and can code a couple simple scripts.
